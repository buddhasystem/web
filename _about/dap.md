### What is DAP?
Since the second decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century the term **Data and Analysis Preservation** (DAP)
is often used in place of the traditional "data preservation" to account for
the fact that data which can’t be analyzed is useless. DAP is commonly described as a union of
* Bit preservation (e.g. data on tape and relevant management policies and techniques)
* Long-term management and preservation of the software infrastructure and application code
* Analysis know-how (knowledge management)

### Bit Preservation
PHENIX relies on capabilities and infrastructure the Scientific Data and Computing Center (SDCC)
at Brookhaven National Laboratory for the long-term preservation of the experiment's data
including the raw data, conditions-type data, simulated and processed data.

### Software Infrastructure and Code
PHENIX is using version control (CVS and git) to manage its code, and virtual machine (VM)
technology to manage the software configuration.

### Knolwedge Management
The Collaboration has undertaken an effort to review, curate, systematize and preserve
knowledge necessary for the analysis of the data. Creation, development and maintenance
of this website is a part of this effort.
